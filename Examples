1)Write a program to check whether the number is divisible by 2 and 3 and both (take prompt)
let number=parseInt(prompt("enter a number:"))
        if (number %2==0 && number %3==0){
            document.write("number is divisible by 2 and 3 both")
        }else{
            document.write("it is not divisible by 2 and 3 and both")
        
        }

o/p:it is not divisible by 2 and 3 and both

2)write a program to find the largest number out of three numbers expected from the user

        let a=parseInt(prompt("enter a number?"))
        let b=parseInt(prompt("enter a number?"))
        let c=parseInt(prompt("enter a number?"))
        if(a>b &&a>c){
            document.write("a is greater b and c")
        }else if (b>a && b>c){
            document.write("b is greater a and c")
        }else{
            document.write("c is greater than a and b")
        }

o/p:c is greater than a and b


3)Accept the following from the user and calculate the percentage of classes attended:
a)Total no .of working days
b)Total no .of days for absent
After calculating percentage show that, if the percentage is less than 75, then student will not be eligible to write exam

let a=parseInt(prompt("Enter the total number of working days: "))
        let b=parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of days you were absent: "))
        let c=a-b
        let d=(c/a)*100
        if(d<75){
            document.write("You are not eligible to write the exam as your attendance percentage is "+d+"%")
        }else{
            document.write("You are eligible to write the exam as your attendance percentage is "+d+"%")
        }

o/p: You are not eligible to write the exam as your attendance percentage is 60%
