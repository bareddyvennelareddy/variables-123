scenario 2:Discount eligibility
An online store offers a discount system based on the following conditions:
1)A customer who spends more than Rs.100 gets a 20% discount.
2)A customer who spends more than Rs.50 but less than or equal to Rs.100 gets a 10% discount.
3)If the customer is a premium member,they receive an extra 5% discount.


  var customer_buyed = parseFloat(prompt("Enter an amount:"));
        var have_memebership=prompt("enter Yes or No!")
        var discount=0
        if(customer_buyed>100){
            discount=customer_buyed*0.20
            
        }
        else if(customer_buyed>50 && customer_buyed<=100){
            discount=customer_buyed*0.10
        }

        if(have_memebership=="yes"){
            let discount1=discount*0.5
            document.write(discount1)
        }else{
            document.write(discount)
        }
